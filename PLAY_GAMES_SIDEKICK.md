# Play Games Sidekick - Should You Enable It?

## What is Play Games Sidekick?

Play Games Sidekick is a Google Play Games feature that provides an in-game overlay allowing players to:
- Access achievements
- View rewards
- See game tips
- All without leaving the game

## Should You Enable It for Tic Tac Toe?

### **Recommendation: NO - You don't need it**

**Reasons:**
1. **Not a Play Games Integrated App**: Your Tic Tac Toe app doesn't use Google Play Games services (achievements, leaderboards, etc.)
2. **Simple Game**: Tic Tac Toe is a casual game that doesn't benefit from Play Games features
3. **Extra Complexity**: Adding Play Games integration requires:
   - Additional dependencies
   - Code changes
   - Play Console configuration
   - Testing overhead

## What to Do in Play Console

When you see the prompt "Add Play Games Sidekick to app bundles you upload":

1. **Click "Skip" or "Not Now"** - This is optional
2. **Or simply ignore it** - It won't affect your app submission

## If You Want to Add Play Games Later

If you decide to add Play Games features in the future (achievements, leaderboards), you would need to:

1. **Add Play Games SDK** to your app
2. **Integrate Play Games services** in your code
3. **Configure in Play Console** under "Play Games Services"
4. **Then enable Sidekick** if desired

## Current Status

- ✅ Your app works perfectly without Play Games Sidekick
- ✅ No action needed
- ✅ You can proceed with app submission

## Summary

**Action Required**: None - Skip this feature for now. Your Tic Tac Toe app doesn't need Play Games Sidekick.
