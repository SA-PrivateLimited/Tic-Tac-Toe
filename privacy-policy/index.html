            <p>
                This privacy policy applies to the Tic Tac Toe app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices
                that was created by SA-Private Limited (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
                The Application does not collect, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information from users.
                All game data, including player scores and betting points, is stored locally on your device and is never
                transmitted to external servers.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
            <p>
                The Application stores the following information locally on your device:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Game Scores:</strong> Win/loss records for Player X and Player O</li>

                <li><strong>Bet Amounts:</strong> The last set betting amount</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This data is stored using AsyncStorage (Android's local storage mechanism) and remains on your device.
                It is not accessible to the Service Provider or any third parties.

            <h2>Data Deletion</h2>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Since all data
                is stored locally on your device and the Application does not transmit any information over the internet,
